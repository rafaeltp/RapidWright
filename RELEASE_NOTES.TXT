============= RapidWright 2018.2.2-beta released on 2018-10-20 =================
Notes:
 - API Additions:
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.device.PIP "public boolean isRouteThru()"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.device.Site "public BEL[] getBELs()"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.SiteInst "public BEL[] getBELs()"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.SiteInst "public String getPrimarySitePinName(String alternateSitePinName)"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.SiteInst "public String getAlternateSitePinName(String primarySitePinName)"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public PBlock getPBlock()"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public void setPBlock(PBlock pblock)"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public Map<String, String> getMetaDataMap()"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public void setMetaDataMap(HashMap<String, String> metaDataMap)"
   
 - API Removals:
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public String[] getExternalInputNames()"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public void setExternalInputNames(String[] externalInputNames)"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public String[] getExternalOutputNames()"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public void setExternalOutputNames(String[] externalOutputNames)"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> getMetaDataMap()"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public void setMetaDataMap(HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> metaDataMap)"
   
 - API Renames:
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.Module "public String getPBlock()" --> "public String getPBlockString()" 
 - Changes Implementation Guide File extension from '.impl.guide' to '.igf'
 - Fixed an issue in the HandPlacer where it would fail to start because of some missing saveDesign() methods.
 - Modules now store PBlocks when using the rapid_compile_ipi flow
 - If no impl guide file is supplied, rapid_compile_ipi will create an example file
 - enables non-LUT routethrus in Router
 - Resolves issue: #7
Known Issues:
 - Netlists that have two ports by same name where one is a single bit
 bus and another is multi-bit are not currently supported (for
 example, a module has an input 'my_signal' and 'my_signal[2:0]' is
 currently not allowed in the EDIF parser.
 - Clock router in Router class is disabled (under development).  
 - PolynomialGenerator is a toy demonstration and does not produce a
 functionally valid circuit.
